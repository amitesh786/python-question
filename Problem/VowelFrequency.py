# Problem: 
# Write a program to count the total number of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) present in a given sentence.

# Exercise Purpose: This exercise introduces “Membership Testing.” By checking if a character belongs to a specific group (the vowels), you learn how to filter data based on categories. This is a fundamental step toward building text-analysis tools or spam filters.

# Given Input: sentence = "Learning Python is fun!"

# Expected Output: Number of vowels: 6

# Solution:

sentence = "Learning Python is fun!"
vowels = "aeiou"
count = 0

for char in sentence.lower():
  if char in vowels:
    count += 1

print(f"Number of vowels: {count}")
